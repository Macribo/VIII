            According to legend,
            Gaelic people descend from an Iberian tribe
            called the Milesians.

            Galamh Míl Espáine,son of Breogan,son of Bile had seven sons,<ins>1</ins> one of whom was a poet called
Amergin the Milesian. <em>

            Amergin led the Milesians to
Ireland,
an island ruled by a tribe of gods called the
Dé Dannan.

            <br></br><br></br>
            The Dé Dannan had won Ireland by defeating their ancient enemy

The Fomorians

            Amergin won permission
from the three queens of the Dé Danann,
to settle in Ireland.

            To win their favor,
            Amergin promised to name the land after the queens,
             Banba, Ériu and Fódla.


             So it is that the Irish for Ireland is
             Éire
 and in poetry we call her Banba and Fóladh. <ins>1</ins><br></br>not our business models; <ins>1.5</ins>

            Amergin's people also had to win the island by engaging in battle with the three kings, their druids and warriors.

            In battle, the Milesian warriors were forced to retreat  back into the ocean beyond the magical boundary of the ninth wave.
